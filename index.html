           <h1>Dream Big</h1>
           <h2>Became a web development</h2>
           <p>What is your motivation for learning to code?
            The biggest motivation is how your life will change. Think about what happens when you learn more; you will gain more skills, have more knowledge to back you up at your work and in your life, and you will be more able to apply some of the things you learn and remember them when push comes to shove.</p>

                <p>Becoming a full stack web developer is not a state of being. It's a process. Code Schools and online courses want to sell this, frankly bullshit, idea that you can study for 12 weeks or a year and boom you are a Full Stack developer. It's wrong headed. At that point you will have the basic skills of a stack of development concepts that make an app. It's Full Stack Light at best, but more likely just marketing.

                    Becoming truly full stack will involve learning that never quite ends. A commitment to understanding just a bit more at the fringe of what you currently know and then repeating.</p>

                <h2>Web Developer</h2>
                <h3 class="orange-color">02-02-2020</h3>
                <p>For every programmer curiosity and the urge of being good at something is always the motivation. If you know why you want to learn web development, go challenge yourself, that is motivation enough. For me it was the desire to make and build my own website.</p>
